# VanillaJS Kanban Board 📝

A clean, interactive Kanban board application designed to organize tasks across "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" states. 

I built this project to bridge the gap between learning syntax and building real-world applications. It focuses on manipulating the DOM without relying on external frameworks like React or Vue.

## 🚀 Key Features (Planned)
* **Dynamic Task Creation:** Add new tasks to the board instantly.
* **State Management:** Move tasks between columns (To Do -> In Progress -> Done).
* **DOM Manipulation:** Create and delete HTML elements using pure JavaScript.
* **Responsive Design:** A layout that works on different screen sizes using CSS Flexbox/Grid.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Flexbox/Grid for layout and custom styling.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Logic, Event Handling, and DOM manipulation.
